# Call for Abstracts for joint symposium on PENSIONS and TAX POLICY at SPA 2026

### Submission deadline: 13 FEB 2026

For this year's SPA conference being held at **Liverpool Hope University (Wed 1st July to Friday 3rd July 2026)**, **the SPA Pensions Policy and Tax Policy groups** are organising a joint symposium at the intersection of our interests. The overall conference theme is 'Hope in Dark Times: Resistance and Radical Change', and by bringing our groups together we want to foreground innovative and transformative approaches to social policy.

We welcome preliminary submissions of relevant papers to join the symposium. Topics may relate to:
- Taxation, inequality and social justice: How pensions and taxation interact with income inequality, gender and racial differences
- Labour market and employment: How pension and taxation policies affect different types of workers (formal/informal, gig economy)
- Intergenerational or comparative perspectives on pensions and taxation
- Social policy innovation and reform: New approaches to pensions and taxation, including experimental policies, reforms, or technological innovations (digitalization in pensions, automated taxation systems)
- Gender, pensions and taxation: How taxation shapes pension outcomes for groups of women and men
- Pensions, taxation and intergenerational fairness: How taxation shapes pension outcomes for different generational groups


We also welcome other topics combining pensions and taxation. 

To support involvement from a diverse group of scholars in the symposium, we have a limited number of bursaries available which would cover conference registration for those who do not have institutional funding available.


Please submit an abstract to Hayley James (h.james1@aston.ac.uk) by 13th Feb, mentioning whether you would like to be considered for a bursary. 


We will then review submissions and get back in touch with you by the end of February to confirm our symposium. Accepted contributors will then also need  to submit their abstracts separately to the SPA's submission system by the conference deadline of 16th March. Instructions will be provided!
